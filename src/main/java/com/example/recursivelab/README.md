# WIP: TechBridge OOP Part 3 Lab

Status: Work in Progress

## Description

This lab is designed to reinforce concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and recursion. It is divided into two main tasks:

1. Create five recursive methods and ensure they terminate properly.
2. Create a `Vehicle` class that has four child classes (`Car`, `Bike`, `Boat`, `Plane`) extending it.

## Requirements

### Recursive Methods

1. Create 5 recursive methods and call them. Each method should be designed to terminate correctly.

### Vehicle Class

1. Create a `Vehicle` class.
2. Develop four subclasses (`Car`, `Bike`, `Boat`, `Plane`) that extend the `Vehicle` class.

## Files Included

- `Vehicle.java`: Contains the `Vehicle` class along with its four child classes.
- `RecursiveMethods.java`: Contains five different recursive methods.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Navigate to the `recursiveLab` directory.
2. Run `javac recursiveLab/*.java` to compile all Java files in the directory.
3. Run `java recursiveLab.RecursiveMethods` to execute the `RecursiveMethods` class and test the recursive methods.

## Additional Information

This lab includes the use of various access modifiers (public, protected, private) within the classes to demonstrate the principles of encapsulation in OOP.
