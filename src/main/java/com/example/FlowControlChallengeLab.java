    /**
     * Assignment: Create a program that does the following:
        - Takes 2 numbers as input. The difference between the numbers canâ€™t be any less than 200.
        - if the difference is less than 200 then the program will have no output and will end.
        - The program should sum up the numbers that are even and also divisible by 4.
        - Then the program should sum up the numbers that are even and also divisible by 8.
        - Then the program should sum up the numbers that are not even and and not divisible by 5.
        - These values should all be displayed at the end of the program.
        - You must use all three kinds of loops and a switch statement.
        - Be sure to properly document your code with comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
