# Bookstore/Library Project
The following assignment is part of the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Part 1 Lab conducted in class. This lab aims to introduce students to the core concepts of OOP, focusing on classes, methods, and variables.

## Project Requirements
Further expand your Bookstore/Library class. Create all methods and class variables. Use creativity to make sure all methods and variables get used.

- There must be at least 10 methods
- There must be at least 10 variables

Create a Person class that represents a customer along with all methods & class variables.

## Architectural Overview
In this small project, you'll find the code organized into four different classes. Each class has a specific role, making the project more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

1. **Book Class**: Manages individual book details and states, such as availability and loan period.
2. **Person Class**: Responsible for customer information and activities related to the library.
3. **Library Class**: Acts as centralized control for the entire library system, managing both books and customers.
4. **MyLibraryApp (Main) Class**: This is the entry point of the application where all classes are integrated and interact with one another.

By segregating responsibilities in this manner, you can work on one class without affecting the others. This makes it easier to expand or modify the project in the future.

## Javadoc Usage
Even though this is a relatively small project, Javadoc comments are used throughout the code. This serves as a practice ground for getting familiar with all the features Javadoc has to offer.
